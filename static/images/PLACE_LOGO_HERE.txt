📸 LOGO PLACEMENT

Place your Robot Forest logo here as: logo.png

The logo you showed me (the minimalist gray "forest" pattern with the geometric 
stacked lines forming a mountain/forest shape) should be saved as:

    logo.png

Requirements:
- Filename: logo.png (exactly)
- Format: PNG with transparency preferred
- Recommended size: 120-150px height (width proportional)
- Max file size: < 100KB (optimize if needed)

The theme is already configured to display this logo in the header navigation.

If you use a different filename or format, update this line in hugo.toml:
    logo = '/images/your-logo-filename.png'

Tip: You can also place blog post images here and reference them in your 
post front matter as:
    featured_image: "/images/post-image.jpg"
