## Who This Is For

Robotics teams excel at autonomy. But scaling from prototype to production requires more than ROS programming—it demands robust infrastructure, secure operations, and data systems that work in the real world.
I work with:

* **Startups** moving from MVP to first deployments.
* **Mid-sized robotics companies** scaling fleets and preparing for commercialisation.

Whether you need help building out your team and processes or deep technical implementation, I’m there, acting as a strategic partner and also rolling up my sleeves to build when needed.

### Some ways I've helped companies at different scales

* **Seed → Series A:** CI/CD blueprint, OTA basics, observability MVP, security baseline.
* **Series B:** MLOps v1, fleet orchestration, SimOps, SOC2 readiness.
* **Series C+:** Cost/performance optimization, vendor selection/implementation, cross-region scaling.

## Engagement Model
Every company is different, which is why I work with varying models depending on what best sets us up for success. 
Some examples include:

* Retainer: Ongoing advisory and implementation.
* Fractional CTO: Strategic leadership + hands-on execution.
* Project-Based: Fixed-scope sprints for high-impact outcomes.

We start with a discovery Session to identify what will drive the most impact.
No project is too small—whether it’s hardening OTA or architecting your data pipeline.
