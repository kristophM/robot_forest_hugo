>Me thinking about the latest hyped AI technology!

I'm a CTO with a focus on early stage, mission-driven startups. I've worked for over 15 years in tech, starting from the hardware side of Silicon Valley to building software orgs from the ground up in a wide range of industries/tech (SaaS, crypto, logistics, mobile, e-commerce, defence, big-data, gen AI/ML, etc.). I've held roles from engineer to CTO and have seen the good, bad, and the ugly of building technology systems and orgs.

## What I do

I help non-technical, mission-driven founders build their first product, hire their core engineering team, and establish a scalable technical foundation. I help companies optimise for their business goals while building secure, scalable, and resilient systems. I approach problems with a business mindset but dive into deep tech as needed. This means working end to end from defining business objectives to actually designing and implementing scalable platforms and products. 

Examples:
- "0 to 1" MVP: Taking an idea and building the initial product, with market validation of features to hit product market fit
- Identify needs and build out core team with a strong cultural and technological foundation that can scale
- Implement scalable infrastructure and process for continuous deployment (CI/CD), project and performance management, and more
- Harden security and privacy controls to meet regulatory compliance requirements and audit standards in a remote/global workforce environment (GDPR, ISO, SOC2, etc.)
- Select the best platforms and cloud products to meet business objectives, minimise costs, and reduce risk (e.g. data warehouse and serverless product selection on Google, AWS, Azure, etc.)
- ...and more!
