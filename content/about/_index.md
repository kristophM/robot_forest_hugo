## What I Do

I approach problems with a business mindset but dive into deep tech as needed. This means working end to end from defining business objectives to actually designing and implementing scalable platforms and products. I tend to focus on the following areas but the list continues to expand. 

<div class="services-grid">

<div class="service-card">
<h3>Fleet Reliability & Observability (Robot Ops/SRE)</h3>
<p>SRE adapted to robots—SLIs/SLOs that actually reflect autonomy performance, uptime, and field reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define SLIs: perception FPS, localization confidence, loop closure rate, planner latency, DDS packet loss, OTA success rate.</li>
<li>Trace edge‑to‑cloud paths; distributed tracing across ROS nodes + cloud services.</li>
<li>Incident response for robots (IR playbooks, postmortems, RCAs) and on‑call design.</li>
<li>Synthetic data/inputs for health checks (e.g., "sensor stubs" for field smoke tests).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="service-card">
<h3>Edge‑Cloud Data Engineering for Robots</h3>
<p>Architect and operate event/log/telemetry/vision pipelines from vehicles to cloud: hot path (ops) and cold path (training/analytics).</p>
<ul>
<li>Unified telemetry schema (time-series + events + blob/video) with governance.</li>
<li>Hot vs. cold data path blueprint: streaming (Kafka/Redpanda), object storage layouts, parquet/iceberg for ML.</li>
<li>Smart uplink strategies: on‑edge filtering, prioritization, compression, GDPR/PII guards.</li>
<li>Data lineage and model/data versioning integrations (DVC/MLflow/LakeFS).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="service-card">
<h3>Embodied MLOps (From Lab to Fleet)</h3>
<p>Productionize perception/planning models on robots: dataset operations, drift detection, staged rollout, shadow testing, rollback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataset pipelines (ingest → curate → label → QA → version → training).</li>
<li>On‑device inferencing pipelines (TensorRT/OpenVINO) with feature flags and AB tests.</li>
<li>Drift/outlier detection and auto-recall of edge samples for re-training.</li>
<!-- <li>Shadow/ghost mode deployments + kill switches + rollout policies.</li> -->
</ul>
</div>

<div class="service-card">
<h3>Secure Robotics & Supply Chain</h3>
<p>Zero Trust for fleets, secure boot, SBOMs, cert rotation, SROS2, OTA hardening, vendor risk, and SOC 2/ISO 27001 alignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure comms: mTLS in ROS graph/DDs bridges, cert lifecycle, network segmentation.</li>
<li>Firmware/OS hardening, secure boot, TPM/TEE, disk encryption, secrets mgmt at the edge.</li>
<li>Supply chain: SBOM/attestations (SLSA), dependency policies, vuln mgmt & patch SLAs.</li>
<li>SOC 2 early readiness: policies + logging + control mapping tailored to robotics.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="service-card">
<h3>Team & Process Scaling for Robotics Orgs</h3>
<p>Org design, hiring pipelines, role charters (platform engineer for robotics, RobOps SRE), on‑call, incident command, tech council.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define swimlanes: autonomy vs platform vs ops; interfaces and SLAs.</li>
<li>On‑call rotations for fleets; incident command & postmortem culture.</li>
<li>Interview rubrics, trial projects, and onboarding playbooks specific to robotics.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Experience

I've built and led organisations for over 20 years in tech, starting from the hardware side of Silicon Valley to building software orgs from the ground up in a wide range of industries/tech (logistics, defence, drones, big-data, gen AI/ML, etc.). I've held roles from engineer to CTO and have seen the good, bad, and the ugly of building technology systems and teams.

## What I care about

* Great documentation that is interesting and useful to read and helps with growing sustainably
* Security and privacy as a mindset and design principle, but not at the expense of the business and productivity
* Designing high performance, scalable, and resilient systems
* Keeping costs lean and mean
* Clear communication with no bullshit and no ego
* Working with people who care about what they're building and have a sense of humour!

## By the way, why _"Robot 'Forest'"?_ 

I spent time in my career as a machine learning (ML) engineer and came across an algorithm for classification called "Random Forest."
I was always impressed by its role in intelligent decision making. This, combined with living near a forest and working 
on robotics gave birth to "Robot Forest"!
